1 Introduction
**************

This package is based on the SVG package (svg.el) written by Lars
Magne Ingebrigtsen and included in Emacs 26.1.  SVG+ provides
additional SVG editing functions.

2 Usage
*******

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML format for specifying images.
If your Emacs build has SVG support, you can create and manipulate
these images with the following functions.

 -- Function: svg+-create width height &rest args
     Create a new, empty SVG image with the specified dimensions.
     ARGS is an argument plist with you can specify following:

     ':stroke-width'
          The default width (in pixels) of any lines created.

     ':stroke'
          The default stroke color on any lines created.

     This function returns an SVG structure, and all the following
     functions work on that structure.

 -- Function: svg+-gradient svg id type stops
     Create a gradient in SVG with identifier ID.  TYPE specifies the
     gradient type, and can be either 'linear' or 'radial'.  STOPS is
     a list of percentage/color pairs.

     The following will create a linear gradient that goes from red at
     the start, to green 25% of the way, to blue at the end:

          (svg+-gradient svg "gradient1" 'linear
                         '((0 . "red") (25 . "green") (100 . "blue")))

     The gradient created (and inserted into the SVG object) can later
     be used by all functions that create shapes.

   All the following functions take an optional list of keyword
parameters that alter the various attributes from their default
values.  Valid attributes include:

':stroke-width'
     The width (in pixels) of lines drawn, and outlines around solid
     shapes.

':stroke-color'
     The color of lines drawn, and outlines around solid shapes.

':fill-color'
     The color used for solid shapes.

':id'
     The identifier of the shape.

':gradient'
     If given, this should be the identifier of a previously defined
     gradient object.

':clip-path'
     Identifier of a clip path.

 -- Function: svg+-rectangle svg x y width height &rest args
     Add a rectangle to SVG where the upper left corner is at position
     X/Y and is of size WIDTH/HEIGHT.

          (svg+-rectangle svg 100 100 500 500 :gradient "gradient1")

 -- Function: svg+-circle svg x y radius &rest args
     Add a circle to SVG where the center is at X/Y and the radius is
     RADIUS.

 -- Function: svg+-ellipse svg x y x-radius y-radius &rest args
     Add a circle to SVG where the center is at X/Y and the horizontal
     radius is X-RADIUS and the vertical radius is Y-RADIUS.

 -- Function: svg+-line svg x1 y1 x2 y2 &rest args
     Add a line to SVG that starts at X1/Y1 and extends to X2/Y2.

 -- Function: svg+-polyline svg points &rest args
     Add a multiple segment line to SVG that goes through POINTS,
     which is a list of X/Y position pairs.

          (svg+-polyline svg '((200 . 100) (500 . 450) (80 . 100))
                         :stroke-color "green")

 -- Function: svg+-polygon svg points &rest args
     Add a polygon to SVG where POINTS is a list of X/Y pairs that
     describe the outer circumference of the polygon.

          (svg+-polygon svg '((100 . 100) (200 . 150) (150 . 90))
                        :stroke-color "blue" :fill-color "red"")

 -- Function: svg+-path svg commands &rest args
     Add the outline of a shape to SVG according to COMMANDS, see
     *note Path Commands::.

     Coordinates by default are absolute.  To use coordinates relative
     to the last position, or - initially - to the origin, set the
     attribute :RELATIVE to 't'.  This attribute can be specified for
     the function or for individual commands.  If specified for the
     function, then all commands use relative coordinates by default.
     To make an individual command use absolute coordinates, set
     :RELATIVE to 'nil'.

          (svg+-path svg
                     '((moveto ((100 . 200)))
                       (elliptical-arc ((100 100 100 -100 :large-arc t)))
                       (lineto ((0 . 0)) :relative nil)
                       (closepath))
                     :stroke-color "blue"
                     :fill-color "lightblue"
                     :relative t)

 -- Function: svg+-text svg text &rest args
     Add a text to SVG.

          (svg+-text
           svg "This is a text"
           :font-size "40"
           :font-weight "bold"
           :stroke "black"
           :fill-color "white"
           :font-family "impact"
           :letter-spacing "4pt"
           :x 300
           :y 400
           :stroke-width 1)

 -- Function: svg+-embed svg image image-type datap &rest args
     Add an embedded (raster) image to SVG.  If DATAP is 'nil', IMAGE
     should be a file name; if not, it should be a binary string
     containing the image data.  IMAGE-TYPE should be a MIME image
     type, for instance '"image/jpeg"'.

          (svg+-embed svg "~/rms.jpg" "image/jpeg" nil
                      :width "100px" :height "100px"
                      :x "50px" :y "75px")

 -- Function: svg+-clip-path svg &rest args
     Add a clipping path to SVG.  If applied to a shape via the
     :CLIP-PATH property, parts of that shape which lie outside of the
     clipping path are not drawn.

          (let ((clip-path (svg+-clip-path svg :id "foo")))
            (svg+-circle clip-path 200 200 175))
          (svg+-rectangle svg 50 50 300 300
                          :fill-color "red"
                          :clip-path "url(#foo)")

 -- Function: svg+-node svg tag &rest args
     Add custom node TAG to SVG.

          (svg+-node svg
                     'rect
                     :width 300 :height 200 :x 50 :y 100 :fill-color "green")

 -- Function: svg+-remove svg id
     Remove the element with identifier 'id' from the 'svg'.

   Finally, the 'svg+-image' takes an SVG object as its parameter and
returns an image object suitable for use in functions like
'insert-image'.  Here's a complete example that creates and inserts an
image with a circle:

     (let ((svg (svg+-create 400 400 :stroke-width 10)))
       (svg+-gradient svg "gradient1" 'linear '((0 . "red") (100 . "blue")))
       (svg+-circle svg 200 200 100 :gradient "gradient1"
                        :stroke-color "green")
       (insert-image (svg+-image svg)))

2.1 Path Commands
=================

 -- Command: moveto points
     Move the pen to the first point in POINTS.  Additional points are
     connected with lines.  POINTS is a list of X/Y coordinate pairs.
     Subsequent 'moveto' commands represent the start of a new
     "subpath".

          (svg+-path svg '((moveto ((200 . 100) (100 . 200) (0 . 100))))
                     :fill-color "white" :stroke "black")

 -- Command: closepath
     End the current subpath by connecting it back to its initial
     point.  A line is drawn along the connection.

          (svg+-path svg '((moveto ((200 . 100) (100 . 200) (0 . 100)))
                           (closepath)
                           (moveto ((75 . 125) (100 . 150) (125 . 125)))
                           (closepath))
                     :fill-color "red" :stroke "black")

 -- Command: lineto points
     Draw a line from the current point to the first element in
     POINTS, which is a list of X/Y position pairs.  If more than one
     point is specified, draw a polyline.
          (svg+-path svg '((moveto ((200 . 100)))
                           (lineto ((100 . 200) (0 . 100))))
                     :fill-color "yellow" :stroke "red")

 -- Command: horizontal-lineto x-coordinates
     Draw a horizontal line from the current point to the first
     element in X-COORDINATES.  Specifying multiple coordinates is
     possible, although usually this doesnâ€™t make sense.

          (svg+-path svg '((moveto ((100 . 200)))
                           (horizontal-lineto (300)))
                     :stroke "green")

 -- Command: vertical-lineto y-coordinates
     Draw vertical lines.

          (svg+-path svg '((moveto ((200 . 100)))
                           (horizontal-lineto (300)))
                     :stroke "green")

 -- Command: curveto coordinate-sets
     Using the first element in COORDINATE-SETS, draw a cubic BÃ©zier
     curve from the current point.  If there are multiple coordinate
     sets, draw a polybÃ©zier.  Each coordinate set is a list of the
     form '(X1 Y1 X2 Y2 X Y)', where (X, Y) is the curveâ€™s end
     point.  (X1, Y1) and (X2, Y2) are control points at the beginning
     and at the end, respectively.

          (svg+-path svg '((moveto ((100 . 100)))
                           (curveto ((200 100 100 200 200 200)
                                     (300 200 0 100 100 100))))
                     :fill-color "transparent" :stroke "red")

 -- Command: smooth-curveto coordinate-sets
     Using the first element in COORDINATE-SETS, draw a cubic BÃ©zier
     curve from the current point.  If there are multiple coordinate
     sets, draw a polybÃ©zier.  Each coordinate set is a list of the
     form '(X2 Y2 X Y)', where (X, Y) is the curveâ€™s end point and
     (X2, Y2) is the corresponding control point.  The first control
     point is the reflection of the second control point of the
     previous command relative to the current point, if that command
     was 'curveto' or 'smooth-curveto'.  Otherwise the first control
     point coincides with the current point.

          (svg+-path svg '((moveto ((100 . 100)))
                           (curveto ((200 100 100 200 200 200)))
                           (smooth-curveto ((0 100 100 100))))
                     :fill "transparent" :stroke "blue")

 -- Command: quadratic-bezier-curveto coordinate-sets
     Using the first element in COORDINATE-SETS, draw a quadratic
     BÃ©zier curve from the current point.  If there are multiple
     coordinate sets, draw a polybÃ©zier.  Each coordinate set is a
     list of the form '(X1 Y1 X Y)', where (X, Y) is the curveâ€™s end
     point and (X1, Y1) is the control point.

          (svg+-path svg '((moveto ((200 . 100)))
                           (quadratic-bezier-curveto ((300 100 300 200)))
                           (quadratic-bezier-curveto ((300 300 200 300)))
                           (quadratic-bezier-curveto ((100 300 100 200)))
                           (quadratic-bezier-curveto ((100 100 200 100))))
                     :fill "transparent" :stroke "pink")

 -- Command: smooth-quadratic-bezier-curveto coordinate-sets
     Using the first element in COORDINATE-SETS, draw a quadratic
     BÃ©zier curve from the current point.  If there are multiple
     coordinate sets, draw a polybÃ©zier.  Each coordinate set is a
     list of the form '(X Y)', where (X, Y) is the curveâ€™s end
     point.  The control point is the reflection of the control point
     of the previous command relative to the current point, if that
     command was 'quadratic-bezier-curveto' or
     'smooth-quadratic-bezier-curveto'.  Otherwise the control point
     coincides with the current point.

          (svg+-path svg '((moveto ((200 . 100)))
                           (quadratic-bezier-curveto ((300 100 300 200)))
                           (smooth-quadratic-bezier-curveto ((200 300)))
                           (smooth-quadratic-bezier-curveto ((100 200)))
                           (smooth-quadratic-bezier-curveto ((200 100))))
                     :fill "transparent" :stroke "lightblue")

 -- Command: elliptical-arc coordinate-sets
     Using the first element in COORDINATE-SETS, draw an elliptical
     arc from the current point.  If there are multiple coordinate
     sets, draw a sequence of elliptical arcs.  Each coordinate set is
     a list of the form '(RX RY X Y)', where (X, Y) is the end point
     of the ellipse, and (RX, RY) are its radii.  Attributes may be
     appended to the list:

     ':x-axis-rotation'
          The angle in degrees by which the x-axis of the ellipse is
          rotated relative to the x-axis of the current coordinate
          system.

     ':large-arc'
          If set to 't', draw an arc sweep greater than or equal to
          180 degrees.  Otherwise, draw a smaller arc sweep.

     ':sweep'
          If set to 't', draw an arc in "positive angle direction".
          Otherwise, draw it in "negative angle direction".

          (svg+-path svg '((moveto ((200 . 250)))
                           (elliptical-arc ((75 75 200 350))))
                     :fill "transparent" :stroke "red")
          (svg+-path svg '((moveto ((200 . 250)))
                           (elliptical-arc ((75 75 200 350 :large-arc t))))
                     :fill "transparent" :stroke "green")
          (svg+-path svg '((moveto ((200 . 250)))
                           (elliptical-arc ((75 75 200 350 :sweep t))))
                     :fill "transparent" :stroke "blue")
          (svg+-path svg '((moveto ((200 . 250)))
                           (elliptical-arc ((75 75 200 350 :large-arc t
                                                :sweep t))))
                     :fill "transparent" :stroke "gray")
          (svg+-path svg '((moveto ((160 . 100)))
                           (elliptical-arc ((40 100 80 0)))

                                                :x-axis-rotation -120)))
                           (elliptical-arc ((40 100 -40 70
                                                :x-axis-rotation -240))))
                     :stroke "pink" :fill "lightblue"

     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  0. PREAMBLE

     The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
     other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of
     freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
     redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
     commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily, this License
     preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for
     their work, while not being considered responsible for
     modifications made by others.

     This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
     works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.
     It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a
     copyleft license designed for free software.

     We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
     free software, because free software needs free documentation: a
     free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms
     that the software does.  But this License is not limited to
     software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless
     of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book.
     We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is
     instruction or reference.

  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
     that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it
     can be distributed under the terms of this License.  Such a
     notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in
     duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein.
     The "Document", below, refers to any such manual or work.  Any
     member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as "you".
     You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work
     in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

     A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing
     the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
     modifications and/or translated into another language.

     A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter
     section of the Document that deals exclusively with the
     relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the
     Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains
     nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject.
     (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a
     Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.)  The
     relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the
     subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
     philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

     The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
     titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in
     the notice that says that the Document is released under this
     License.  If a section does not fit the above definition of
     Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant.
     The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.  If the
     Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are
     none.

     The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
     listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice
     that says that the Document is released under this License.  A
     Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text
     may be at most 25 words.

     A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable
     copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to
     the general public, that is suitable for revising the document
     straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images
     composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some
     widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input
     to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of
     formats suitable for input to text formatters.  A copy made in an
     otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of
     markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent
     modification by readers is not Transparent.  An image format is
     not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text.  A
     copy that is not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

     Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
     ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
     SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and
     standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for
     human modification.  Examples of transparent image formats
     include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Opaque formats include proprietary
     formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word
     processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools
     are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML,
     PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output
     purposes only.

     The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page
     itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly,
     the material this License requires to appear in the title page.
     For works in formats which do not have any title page as such,
     "Title Page" means the text near the most prominent appearance of
     the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the
     text.

     The "publisher" means any person or entity that distributes
     copies of the Document to the public.

     A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document
     whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in
     parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another
     language.  (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned
     below, such as "Acknowledgements", "Dedications", "Endorsements",
     or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title" of such a section when
     you modify the Document means that it remains a section "Entitled
     XYZ" according to this definition.

     The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
     which states that this License applies to the Document.  These
     Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference
     in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any
     other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is
     void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.

  2. VERBATIM COPYING

     You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
     commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
     copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License
     applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that
     you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License.
     You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
     reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute.
     However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies.  If
     you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also
     follow the conditions in section 3.

     You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
     and you may publicly display copies.

  3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

     If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly
     have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100,
     and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
     enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
     these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
     Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must also
     clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
     copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
     words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
     other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
     limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
     Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
     copying in other respects.

     If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
     legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
     reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto
     adjacent pages.

     If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
     numbering more than 100, you must either include a
     machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
     state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location
     from which the general network-using public has access to
     download using public-standard network protocols a complete
     Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.  If you
     use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,
     when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to
     ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at
     the stated location until at least one year after the last time
     you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or
     retailers) of that edition to the public.

     It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors
     of the Document well before redistributing any large number of
     copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated
     version of the Document.

  4. MODIFICATIONS

     You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document
     under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you
     release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with
     the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus
     licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version
     to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you must do
     these things in the Modified Version:

       A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title
          distinct from that of the Document, and from those of
          previous versions (which should, if there were any, be
          listed in the History section of the Document).  You may use
          the same title as a previous version if the original
          publisher of that version gives permission.

       B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
          entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in
          the Modified Version, together with at least five of the
          principal authors of the Document (all of its principal
          authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you
          from this requirement.

       C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
          Modified Version, as the publisher.

       D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

       E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
          adjacent to the other copyright notices.

       F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license
          notice giving the public permission to use the Modified
          Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown
          in the Addendum below.

       G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
          Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's
          license notice.

       H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.

       I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title,
          and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new
          authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on
          the Title Page.  If there is no section Entitled "History"
          in the Document, create one stating the title, year,
          authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title
          Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as
          stated in the previous sentence.

       J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document
          for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and
          likewise the network locations given in the Document for
          previous versions it was based on.  These may be placed in
          the "History" section.  You may omit a network location for
          a work that was published at least four years before the
          Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version
          it refers to gives permission.

       K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or
          "Dedications", Preserve the Title of the section, and
          preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each
          of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given
          therein.

       L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
          unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section
          numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the
          section titles.

       M. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
          may not be included in the Modified Version.

       N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled
          "Endorsements" or to conflict in title with any Invariant
          Section.

       O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.

     If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
     appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no
     material copied from the Document, you may at your option
     designate some or all of these sections as invariant.  To do
     this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the
     Modified Version's license notice.  These titles must be distinct
     from any other section titles.

     You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it
     contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by
     various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that
     the text has been approved by an organization as the
     authoritative definition of a standard.

     You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text,
     and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end
     of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one
     passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be
     added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If
     the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover,
     previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity
     you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may
     replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous
     publisher that added the old one.

     The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this
     License give permission to use their names for publicity for or
     to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

  5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     You may combine the Document with other documents released under
     this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for
     modified versions, provided that you include in the combination
     all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents,
     unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your
     combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all
     their Warranty Disclaimers.

     The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
     multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a
     single copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the
     same name but different contents, make the title of each such
     section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the
     name of the original author or publisher of that section if
     known, or else a unique number.  Make the same adjustment to the
     section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license
     notice of the combined work.

     In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled
     "History" in the various original documents, forming one section
     Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
     "Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You
     must delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements."

  6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
     documents released under this License, and replace the individual
     copies of this License in the various documents with a single
     copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow
     the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the
     documents in all other respects.

     You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
     distribute it individually under this License, provided you
     insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and
     follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim
     copying of that document.

  7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other
     separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of
     a storage or distribution medium, is called an "aggregate" if the
     copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the
     legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the
     individual works permit.  When the Document is included in an
     aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the
     aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the
     Document.

     If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
     copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one
     half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be
     placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate,
     or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in
     electronic form.  Otherwise they must appear on printed covers
     that bracket the whole aggregate.

  8. TRANSLATION

     Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
     distribute translations of the Document under the terms of
     section 4.  Replacing Invariant Sections with translations
     requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you
     may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in
     addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections.
     You may include a translation of this License, and all the
     license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers,
     provided that you also include the original English version of
     this License and the original versions of those notices and
     disclaimers.  In case of a disagreement between the translation
     and the original version of this License or a notice or
     disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

     If a section in the Document is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
     "Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to
     Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing
     the actual title.

  9. TERMINATION

     You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void,
     and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

     However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
     license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
     provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly
     and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the
     copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
     reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

     Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
     reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of
     the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time
     you have received notice of violation of this License (for any
     work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation
     prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

     Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate
     the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from
     you under this License.  If your rights have been terminated and
     not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of
     the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

  10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of
     the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
     <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

     Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version
     number.  If the Document specifies that a particular numbered
     version of this License "or any later version" applies to it, you
     have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
     that specified version or of any later version that has been
     published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.  If
     the Document does not specify a version number of this License,
     you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the
     Free Software Foundation.  If the Document specifies that a proxy
     can decide which future versions of this License can be used,
     that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version
     permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the
     Document.

  11. RELICENSING

     "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site" (or "MMC Site") means
     any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and
     also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those
     works.  A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such
     a server.  A "Massive Multiauthor Collaboration" (or "MMC")
     contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus
     published on the MMC site.

     "CC-BY-SA" means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
     license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a
     not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in
     San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of
     that license published by that same organization.

     "Incorporate" means to publish or republish a Document, in whole
     or in part, as part of another Document.

     An MMC is "eligible for relicensing" if it is licensed under this
     License, and if all works that were first published under this
     License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently
     incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover
     texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior
     to November 1, 2008.

     The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the
     site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1,
     2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing.

ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents
====================================================

To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

       Copyright (C)  YEAR  YOUR NAME.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with no Invariant Sections, no Front-Cover Texts, and no Back-Cover
       Texts.  A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.

   If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover
Texts, replace the "with...Texts." line with this:

         with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with
         the Front-Cover Texts being LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts
         being LIST.

   If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other
combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the
situation.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
permit their use in free software.
